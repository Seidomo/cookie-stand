# cookie-stand

- contribiution

i was stuck for more than 2 hours but with the help of Skyler (TA)
and the rest me and Wondweson my classmate try to figure it out together
and got stuck again and waiting for a TA again because i cant go further with the code.
now i am stuck for so long that my mind is gonna blow and am out of resources.

today was Lab 07 i have finished my previous assignement wich was Lab 06 using the Demo 
of Lena as a reference so i will like to thank Lena for that but the constructive one i tried 
my best but as usual i had to call a TA to help me with the side colom and i would like to thank 
Skyler for that.

well for today am a little behind working on the css for the cookie stand
because i thought the wire framing assignment was for today and i wasted much of my time on that 

i think today was good day for me i get rid of all the junc code or as its called DRY code and did a better one which is shorter and cleaner but at first it wouldnt run because i forgot quotations while i was creating my table but with help oh TA Chance i was able to find the bug and now it runs snf also di the total row too
