i was stuck for more than 2 hours but with the help of Skyler (TA)
and the rest me and Wondweson my classmate try to figure it out together
and got stuck again and waiting for a TA again because i cant go further with the code.
now i am stuck for so long that my mind is gonna blow and am out of resources.

today was Lab 07 i have finished my previous assignement wich was Lab 06 using the Demo 
of Lena as a reference so i will like to thank Lena for that but the constructive one i tried 
my best but as usual i had to call a TA to help me with the side colom and i would like to thank 
Skyler for that.
